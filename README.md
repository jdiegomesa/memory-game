## Design

The [app's design](https://www.figma.com/file/xCc9YElTsVV4khzzHvWlGX/Memory-Game?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=7Igydf9OgLCRKOWG-1) for this project was made for mobile and desktop layouts in Figma

## Use

Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all the dependencies required.\
\
You must have in mind that this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## TailwindCSS

The project use PostCSS v.8.4 and TailwindCSS v.3.3 for the styles.\
In the project directory, `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` files manage the configuration to process the entry file, located in `\src\styles\main.css`.\
The npm scripts was modified to run two processes: the styles processing with PostCSS CLI, and the React processing. 

## ReactJS

The project use React v.18.2\
As a CRA project, the entry file is located in `\src\index.js` and the apps's logic begins in `\src\App.js`\
You can find the React components in directory `\src\components\`

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!.\
